          <p>
            <br>With a mom who is a software developer, she always got mad at me when I said a career in coding would be
            boring. Despite this, I still wanted to learn how to code, so I self-taught myself the basics of website
            development using Udemy. From design to coding, this is the first major project that I have completely done
            by myself. This website is a mixture of Bootstrap, CSS, and HTML, and is 100% coded by me using Virtual
            Studio Code. And yes mom, coding is fun, but spending an hour debugging your code
            is painful. Maybe JavaScript or Python will be more fun? I'll update you on that when I finish my 90 hours
            of coding lectures.

              experience that everyone can find an aspect to love. Every year, a new problem and robot game is
              introduced, and our goal is to create an innovation that solves the problem, a robot that scores the most
              points, and an engineering notebook while showing good sportsmanship. </p>

          <h2 class="pb-4">Starting From the Bottom</h2>
          <p>My first experience with engineering, my 6th-grade Intro to Robotics class, allowed me to push my
            imagination to the brim. After seeing how passionate I was for robotics, my teacher, Ms. Rodrique suggested
            that I join one of her First Lego League teams. Since then, I have continued to become more passionate about
            robotics, and I have never looked back. When I circled Introduction to Robotics during course selection, I
            had no idea that it was going to lead me to the current passion that I have.</p>

            <p>Since I was a new to FLL, my first year was packed with information. I learned how important it was to
              plan your robot and code, how important simple code and attachments were, how important sensors are, ect…
              This year of FLL really showed me what was possible from such a simple game. In the end, we were awarded
              with inspiration award and got 3rd place in robot game at state competition.</p>

          <p>For my 2nd year of FLL (and my last) Ms. Rodrique asked if I wanted to create my own team, I accepted. I
            decided to form my team with two other co-captains (John Robert Walker and Madeline Brain), which allowed me
            to focus more on robot game.
            <br>
            <br>As a team, we shaped how FLL teams at Armstrong Middle School competed. With a full engineering
            notebook, we set a new level of documentation for teams. With a fully printed board, we set a new
            standard of neatness.
            <br>
            <br>I was in the robot room almost every day leading up to the state competition. There were times when I
            got angry at the hunk of plastic, that we called a robot but there were other times that I felt accomplished
            when the code ran consistently. This was my most successful year of FLL. We placed 1st in the robot game at
            state and regionals, which was never done before at Armstrong Middle School. In total, we got 3 awards (the
            Inspiration Award, the Innovative Solution Award, and the Robot Performance Award); We broke another record
            for the most awards given to a team in Mississippi FLL history.
